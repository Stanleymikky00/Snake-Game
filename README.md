## Snake Game (Python)

A classic Snake game built with the `turtle` graphics module in Python.

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

## Project Structure
main.py         # Game launcher
snake.py        # Snake class and logic
food.py         # Food spawning logic
scoreboard.py   # Score tracking

## Requirement 

Python 3.x
turtle (comes with Python standard libraey)

## Future AI Integration

I plan to implement an AI agent that plays the Snake game autonomously using:
- **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning or Deep Q-Learning)**
- State-action modeling of snake movement
- Reward system based on food, collisions, and survival time

This will be available in a separate file or branch (`ai_snake.py`).
